# About repository

That's a repository I used to make experiments for [the HSE topological data analysis course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq3E5oubNNoAhStWZNUacUDLT0fOOBBik).
Then I stared research for my graduate thesis here.

The first part of the researh was repeating of experiments from Bobrowskis and Skrabas article [Homological Percolation and the Euler Characteristic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10146) and runing few my own. 

The second part was analysis, how connetced researched parameters (the first $k$-dimensional giant cycles births and EC-zeros) for persistent models, defined by voronoi cells of dual lattices.
